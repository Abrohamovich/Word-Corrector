# Java Project Documentation

---

This Java project contains three classes: `Main`, `DataProvider`, and `Corrector`.
The programme accepts an array of strings with words where some characters have been replaced by the ‘b’ character.
Using `Correct` class replaces "b" with "o" (if they are) in all strings of the array.
